## Directory Structure

Four different directories.
- `/data`: Two types of text files: vertex and edges. Vertex text files display sampled universities per major and edge text files show a directed connection between University X and University Y.

- `/material`: Contains the main research paper referred to, its supplementary paper, and my 2-page research report.
  
- `/results`: CSV contains network DAG for Computer Science along with other attributes. The rest are resultant files displaying predicted university ranking based on two algorithms - Page Rank and Minimum Violation Rankings (a type of Monte Carlo Markov Chain algorithm) as described in the research paper.

- `/scripts`: Python files to parse text files into CSV as well as to implement both algorithms. CQL files to run Cypher queries to load the network or find the shortest weighted path between nodes on the network using the Neo4j software.riable configurations
